# Solana Research Lab

A limited set of (999)  NFTs, those who mint this will aquire far advantage and understanding on nfts over those who miss it

### Treasure Hunt?

Not exactly, this is not a hardcore treasure hunt, but nothing will be given for free,
I will lead you to gather all the information that you need to mint the SRL. For people with tech skills it wont even be a challenge but perhaps even for them most of this details may have been just ignored until now. And for anyone without dev skills this is being built mostly for you, but you will have enough time to gather the basic knowledge that is needed for this.

>knowledge is power



### Before the min you are going to aquire:

- Ability to use some basic dev tools
- Skills to mint any project from your own machine and be safe from malicious or overloaded sites.
- Skills to launch your own nft projects

### After the mint

- Even more knowledge and tools will be bring to the table.


## Roadmap

- Drop the collection
- Add it to a market place
- Create the SRL bot to bind github account with your SRL holder wallet
- Create a Github private project that SRL holders will be able to access to use as they will (including the bot and any many other project that i want to bring up, example: a tool to find official nfts on solsea before they are verified, rarity sniper tool for any nft project before it releases, **tool to check nft traits before they are minted** and more)

## Possible Roadmap addons
- SRL DAO
- SRL token ( reward to github contributors, reward to the original collection holders, utility to create new SRL nfts like cyberkongz)
